Implementation of the `GNU coreutils <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>`_ in a range of languages for fun and learning.

The idea is to create simple and readable implementations that people can refer to to learn, or even join in with adding unique languages.

A lot of languages will be using the GNU coreutils in their standard libraries, which does make this whole things rather redundant. Regardless
of that, it could be a good way to understand what makes a good CLI tool and also can be used as a resource for learning.

.. warning::
    I highly recommend not using any of these binaries/scripts. Please use the actual `GNU coreutils <https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/>`_

Below you will find all of the current languages and their implemented utils.
