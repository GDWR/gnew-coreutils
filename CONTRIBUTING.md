# Contributing


## Adding a command
- Only make a pull request for one language's command (i.e. `cat`) at a time
- View the language's `CONTRIBUTING.md` for specific linting/formatting requirements
  - If there is none, ðŸ¤  it's the wild west bucko.

## Adding a language
- Make an issue outlining the language
- Make a PR adding the language and one command, I'd recommend something simple like `true` or `yes`
  - The PR should add the language to the list in `docs/generate_language_docs.py`
